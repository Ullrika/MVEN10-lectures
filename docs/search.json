Such values are known as quantiles.\nA quantile can be denoted with the letter P, together with the associated probability that the quantity would take a value below the quantile. For example, the value that divides a probability distribution into two parts with equal probabilities is the P50 quantile.\nThis value is also known as the median.\nQuartiles divide a probability distribution into four sections of equal probability. The first quartile is P25. The second quartile is the median P50. The third quartile is P75.\nA boxplot visualises quartiles.\nA percentile is another name for a quantile defined by the probability to the left of the quantile.\n\n\nProbability Density Function\nMost continuous quantities have a Probability Density Function (PDF).\nThe Probability Density Function express probabilities as area under its curve. The total area under the curve is 1, corresponding to 100% probability.\nThe area under the PDF curve to the left of the median is 50%.\nThe PDF can be thought of as a smooth histogram for a continuous quantity. Note that when used for a probability distribution, the area for the histogram should be 1.\n\n\nCumulative Distribution Function\nA probability distribution can be represented by its Cumulative Distribution Function (often abbreviated as CDF). The CDF gives the probability that the quantity is less than or equal to any specified value\nThe CDF contains all the information about probabilities for the quantity: for example, it can be used to calculate the probability that the quantity lies in any specified range of values.\nThis is a curve over the possible range of the quantity (on the x-axis) increasing from 0 to 100% probability (on the y-axis)."

It is a single true value which is uncertain, and the distribution represents uncertainty about P.\nIn the center, you see a probability distribution for a variable quantity. This variable V has multiple true values. The probability distribution represents variability of V.\nTo the right you see a probabilistic model for both variability and uncertainty. We use a probability distribution to represent variability in this variable, but the true distribution for variability is unknown and we use probability distributions to represent our uncertainty about it’s variability. This distribution is sometimes referred to as a spaghetti plot or two-dimensional distribution.\nUncertainty may be altered (either reduced or increased) by further research, because it results from limitations in knowledge.\nVariability cannot be altered by obtaining more knowledge, because it refers to real differences in the world or how the assessors choose to model the world.\nIt is important that assessors distinguish uncertainty and variability because they have different implications for decision-making: informing decisions about whether to invest resources in research aimed at reducing uncertainty or in management options aimed at influencing variability (e.g. to change exposures to subgroups of the population)."

(3p)\nProvide at least three arguments why a TDI on 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw given the data provided so far is a conservative choice. (3p)\nProvide at least two arguments to why too conservative choices of TDIs might be problematic in general. (2p)\n\nThe frequency as well as the severity of coumarin hepatotoxicity in the human subpopulation is considered as relevant, and therefore the effect of coumarin on humans should be considered in hazard assessment.\nIn 1999, an expert opinion “on the assessment of coumarin in medicinal products with regard to a hepatotoxic effect in humans” was commissioned by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) in Germany. This opinion (read assessment) considered 82 case reports of possible coumarin-associated liver damage.\nFive cases (10%) occurred at the lowest doses (25 and 30 mg daily); of the three cases from Germany documented in more detail, two had developed hepatitis. According to the expert report, for part of the population liver damage cannot be ruled out at a daily dose of 25 mg coumarin.\nIn order to extrapolate from this effect level to a human NOAEL, a factor of 5 is considered justified in the case of a severe effect at the lowest observed adverse effect level.\nUsing the established safe daily dose of 5 mg coumarin for an adult weighing 60 kg, a (rounded) TDI of 0.1 mg/kg body weight was derived by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).\nAbraham et al. (2010) concluded that a TDI of 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw can be justified based on animal as well as human data.\n\nDiscuss in what way is a TDI on 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw can be seen as a less conservative choice compared to before.

An exposure assessment was carried out for young children by asking parents to children aged between 2 and 5 years to keep food records for two non-consecutive 3-day periods. 140 children ate cinnamon or cinnamon-containing products at least on on of the six days recorded, and 47% of the consumption days were between September and December.\nFor a 4-year-old child weighing 15 kg, a daily consumption of three cinnamon star cookies (“Zimtsterne” weighing about 6 g each) with the maximum level of coumarin measured in this product (Table 1 in Abraham et al. 2010) resulted in a coumarin exposure of 0.13 mg/kg body weight (0.046 mg/kg body weight daily for the cookies with the median level).\nPlease do the following task:\n\nConfirm the calculations of exposure under the maximum and median levels of coumarin measured in cinnamon star cookies (“Zimtsterne”).

However, consumers who really eat a lot may have a risk if they belong to the sensitive subgroup.\n\n\nSo should we be concerned with children eating Christmas cookies or not?\nAs pointed out by Abraham et al. (2010), the exposure might be higher since “other coumarin-containing foods may be consumed simultaneously”.\nYour task is to answer the question: Are 4-year-old children in Germany consuming cinnamon star cookies during Christmas season at risk?\n\nPlan and evaluate a risk assessment for 4-year-old children in Germany that consume cinnamon star cookies during Christmas season using the information provided above in which you include an uncertainty analysis.

    "text": "Assessment on coumarin\n\nHazard assessment\nCoumarin (1,2-benzopyrone, CAS No. 91-64-5) is an ingredient in cinnamon known to e.g. cause liver damages (Abraham et al. 2010).\nAn overall NOAEL for liver toxicity on 10 mg coumarin/kg bw/day has been derived from the most sensitive animal species in a set of toxicological studies.\nThe value for the NOAEL was taken from a study on dogs by Hagan et al. (1967) where coumarin was reported to give hepatotoxic effects in dogs given 25 and 50 mg/kg bw/day coumarin for longer periods, but not in dogs given 10 mg/kg bw/day coumarin for up to 350 days.\nA TDI of 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw was established by EFSA (2004) by applying a safety factor of 100.\n\nAnswer with complete sentences the following questions:\n\nWhy was a safety factor applied when EFSA derived the TDI and explain what the value 100 comes from? (3p)\nProvide at least three arguments why a TDI on 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw given the data provided so far is a conservative choice. (3p)\nProvide at least two arguments to why too conservative choices of TDIs might be problematic in general. (2p)\n\nThe frequency as well as the severity of coumarin hepatotoxicity in the human subpopulation is considered as relevant, and therefore the effect of coumarin on humans should be considered in hazard assessment.\nIn 1999, an expert opinion “on the assessment of coumarin in medicinal products with regard to a hepatotoxic effect in humans” was commissioned by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) in Germany. This opinion (read assessment) considered 82 case reports of possible coumarin-associated liver damage.\nFive cases (10%) occurred at the lowest doses (25 and 30 mg daily); of the three cases from Germany documented in more detail, two had developed hepatitis. According to the expert report, for part of the population liver damage cannot be ruled out at a daily dose of 25 mg coumarin.\nIn order to extrapolate from this effect level to a human NOAEL, a factor of 5 is considered justified in the case of a severe effect at the lowest observed adverse effect level.\nUsing the established safe daily dose of 5 mg coumarin for an adult weighing 60 kg, a (rounded) TDI of 0.1 mg/kg body weight was derived by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).\nAbraham et al. (2010) concluded that a TDI of 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw can be justified based on animal as well as human data.\n\nDiscuss in what way is a TDI on 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw can be seen as a less conservative choice compared to before.

    "text": "Is cinnamon safe to consume?\n\nHazard assessment\nRevisit the coumarin hazard assessment described above and\n\nConsider the situation where the human NOAEL instead was x mg coumarin per kg per day. Propose and justify a new TDI in light of available data! For full points, show equations and the code for your calculations. (3p)\n\n\n\n\nExposure assessment\nThere is a concern that extreme consumption of cinnamon, especially during Christmas season, can result in unacceptable exposure to coumarin. An exposure assessment was carried out for young children by asking parents to children aged between 2 and 5 years to keep food records for two non-consecutive 3-day periods. 140 children ate cinnamon or cinnamon-containing products at least on on of the six days recorded, and 47% of the consumption days were between September and December.\nFor a 4-year-old child weighing 15 kg, a daily consumption of three cinnamon star cookies (“Zimtsterne” weighing about 6 g each) with the maximum level of coumarin measured in this product (Table 1 in Abraham et al. 2010) resulted in a coumarin exposure of 0.13 mg/kg body weight (0.046 mg/kg body weight daily for the cookies with the median level).\nPlease do the following task:\n\nConfirm the calculations of exposure under the maximum and median levels of coumarin measured in cinnamon star cookies (“Zimtsterne”). For full points, show equations and the code for your calculations. (2p)\n\n\n\nRisk assessment\nAbraham et al. (2010) concluded\n\n\nAs is evident from the estimation of exposure, heavy consumers may reach a daily coumarin intake of 0.1 mg/kg body weight corresponding to the TDI just from the consumption of Christmas-related foods during autumn and winter. With an additional consumption of cinnamon, these consumers may exceed the TDI.\n\n\nand\n\n\nTherefore, no risk of hepatotoxicity of coumarin is expected for the vast majority of the population consuming low or moderate amounts of (cassia) cinnamon. However, consumers who really eat a lot may have a risk if they belong to the sensitive subgroup.\n\n\nSo should we be concerned with children eating Christmas cookies or not?\nAs pointed out by Abraham et al. (2010), the exposure might be higher since “other coumarin-containing foods may be consumed simultaneously”.\nYour task is to answer the question: Are 4-year-old children in Germany consuming cinnamon star cookies during Christmas season at risk?\n\nPlan and evaluate a risk assessment for 4-year-old children in Germany that consume cinnamon star cookies during Christmas season using the information provided above in which you include an uncertainty analysis. (15p)\n\nConsider\n\nbetween individual variability in body weights. Justify your choice of values based on information in the ExpoFacts Database (Zenié and Reina, 2007)\nbetween individual variability in consumption. Justify your choice of values using your own experience.\nvariability in levels of coumarin in cookies. Justify your choice of values from data in Table 1 in Abraham et al. (2010) and that cookies can have different weights.\n\nUse the TDI of 0.1 mg/kg bw.\nLet us assume that 4-year-old German children only consume cinnamon star cookies.\nYou are the only expert involved in the assessment.\nRisk managers require you to be at least 75% certain in your answer to be able to use the conclusion as scientific advice. Therefore, communicate your uncertainty in the conclusion in an honest and transparent way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons for reduction in points from total\n\n\n\nAnalysis is only expressed with reference to code\nSteps in the analysis is not explained or justified\nConclusion is not backed up by the analysis\nAssumptions are not presented\nNo information on the experts uncertainty in the conclusion\nNo graphical visualisation\nOnly worst case analysis (i.e. no refined approach for uncertainty analysis by modelling variability by probability distributions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that you can get up to 10 points on this task if you provide a plan of the assessment even if you do not carry out all parts."

    "text": "Assessment on coumarin\n\nHazard assessment\nCoumarin (1,2-benzopyrone, CAS No. 91-64-5) is an ingredient in cinnamon known to e.g. cause liver damages (Abraham et al. 2010).\nAn overall NOAEL for liver toxicity on 10 mg coumarin/kg bw/day has been derived from the most sensitive animal species in a set of toxicological studies.\nThe value for the NOAEL was taken from a study on dogs by Hagan et al. (1967) where coumarin was reported to give hepatotoxic effects in dogs given 25 and 50 mg/kg bw/day coumarin for longer periods, but not in dogs given 10 mg/kg bw/day coumarin for up to 350 days.\nA TDI of 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw was established by EFSA (2004) by applying a safety factor of 100.\n\nAnswer with complete sentences the following questions:\n\nWhy was a safety factor applied when EFSA derived the TDI and explain what the value 100 comes from? (3p)\nProvide at least three arguments why a TDI on 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw given the data provided so far is a conservative choice. (3p)\nProvide at least two arguments to why too conservative choices of TDIs might be problematic in general. (2p)\n\nThe frequency as well as the severity of coumarin hepatotoxicity in the human subpopulation is considered as relevant, and therefore the effect of coumarin on humans should be considered in hazard assessment.\nIn 1999, an expert opinion “on the assessment of coumarin in medicinal products with regard to a hepatotoxic effect in humans” was commissioned by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) in Germany. This opinion (read assessment) considered 82 case reports of possible coumarin-associated liver damage.\nFive cases (10%) occurred at the lowest doses (25 and 30 mg daily); of the three cases from Germany documented in more detail, two had developed hepatitis. According to the expert report, for part of the population liver damage cannot be ruled out at a daily dose of 25 mg coumarin.\nIn order to extrapolate from this effect level to a human NOAEL, a factor of 5 is considered justified in the case of a severe effect at the lowest observed adverse effect level.\nUsing the established safe daily dose of 5 mg coumarin for an adult weighing 60 kg, a (rounded) TDI of 0.1 mg/kg body weight was derived by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).\nAbraham et al. (2010) concluded that a TDI of 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw can be justified based on animal as well as human data.\n\nDiscuss in what way is a TDI on 0.1 mg coumarin/kg bw can be seen as a less conservative choice compared to before.

    "text": "Is cinnamon safe to consume?\n\nHazard assessment\nRevisit the coumarin hazard assessment described above and\n\nConsider the situation where the human NOAEL instead was 205 mg coumarin per kg per day. Propose and justify a new TDI in light of available data! For full points, show equations and the code for your calculations. (3p)\n\n\n\n\nExposure assessment\nThere is a concern that extreme consumption of cinnamon, especially during Christmas season, can result in unacceptable exposure to coumarin. An exposure assessment was carried out for young children by asking parents to children aged between 2 and 5 years to keep food records for two non-consecutive 3-day periods. 140 children ate cinnamon or cinnamon-containing products at least on on of the six days recorded, and 47% of the consumption days were between September and December.\nFor a 4-year-old child weighing 15 kg, a daily consumption of three cinnamon star cookies (“Zimtsterne” weighing about 6 g each) with the maximum level of coumarin measured in this product (Table 1 in Abraham et al. 2010) resulted in a coumarin exposure of 0.13 mg/kg body weight (0.046 mg/kg body weight daily for the cookies with the median level).\nPlease do the following task:\n\nConfirm the calculations of exposure under the maximum and median levels of coumarin measured in cinnamon star cookies (“Zimtsterne”). For full points, show equations and the code for your calculations. (2p)\n\n\n\nRisk assessment\nAbraham et al. (2010) concluded\n\nAs is evident from the estimation of exposure, heavy consumers may reach a daily coumarin intake of 0.1 mg/kg body weight corresponding to the TDI just from the consumption of Christmas-related foods during autumn and winter. With an additional consumption of cinnamon, these consumers may exceed the TDI.\n\nand\n\nTherefore, no risk of hepatotoxicity of coumarin is expected for the vast majority of the population consuming low or moderate amounts of (cassia) cinnamon. However, consumers who really eat a lot may have a risk if they belong to the sensitive subgroup.\n\nSo should we be concerned with children eating Christmas cookies or not?\nAs pointed out by Abraham et al. (2010), the exposure might be higher since “other coumarin-containing foods may be consumed simultaneously”.\nYour task is to answer the question: Are 4-year-old children in Germany consuming cinnamon star cookies during Christmas season at risk?\n\nPlan and evaluate a risk assessment for 4-year-old children in Germany that consume cinnamon star cookies during Christmas season using the information provided above in which you include an uncertainty analysis. (15p)\n\nConsider\n\nbetween individual variability in body weights. Justify your choice of values based on information in the ExpoFacts Database (Zenié and Reina, 2007)\nbetween individual variability in consumption. Justify your choice of values using your own experience.\nvariability in levels of coumarin in cookies. Justify your choice of values from data in Table 1 in Abraham et al. (2010) and that cookies can have different weights.\n\nUse the TDI of 0.1 mg/kg bw.\nLet us assume that 4-year-old German children only consume cinnamon star cookies.\nYou are the only expert involved in the assessment.\nRisk managers require you to be at least 75% certain in your answer to be able to use the conclusion as scientific advice. Therefore, communicate your uncertainty in the conclusion in an honest and transparent way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons for reduction in points from total\n\n\n\nAnalysis is only expressed with reference to code\nSteps in the analysis is not explained or justified\nConclusion is not backed up by the analysis\nAssumptions are not presented\nNo information on the experts uncertainty in the conclusion\nNo graphical visualisation\nOnly worst case analysis (i.e. no refined approach for uncertainty analysis by modelling variability by probability distributions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that you can get up to 10 points on this task if you provide a plan of the assessment even if you do not carry out all parts."
