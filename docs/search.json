Methods have been developed to reduce linguistic uncertainty and cognitive biases when experts make judgements, and to aggregate judgements by a group of experts.\nQuantitative judgements, e.g. judgements expressed by subjective probabilities are preferable over qualitative expressions of uncertainty. The reasons are that\n\nqualitative judgements have different meanings for different people, and\nquantitative judgements can be combined using probability rules (probability calculations)\n\nEFSA defines Expert Knowledge Elicitation as\n\nA systematic, documented and reviewable process to retrieve expert judgements from a group of experts, often in the form of a probability distribution.\n\nIn general, it is possible to make a quantitative judgement when the question asked to an expert is well-defined.\nThe expert should also feel that she has some basis to make his/her judgement.\n\nA good expert makes judgements where she has domain knowledge and is hesitant to make judgements for questions where she feels there is not enough basis for a judgement.\n\nIt is also important that experts receive training in making probabilistic judgements to ensure they understand them.\n\n\nThis mini-lecture introduces probability distributions for a binary event, a categorical quantity, a discrete quantity and a continuous quantity. The terms cumulative probability function, probability density function, and quantile and boxplot. The aim of the lecture is to that the student understand the terms quantile and percentile."

    "text": "Visualising probability distributions\nA probability distribution for a continuous quantity can be plotted in various formats:\n\nA Box plot\nA Probability Density Function (PDF)\nA Cumulative Probability Distribution (CDF)\n\nHere they are plotted together to show how they are related\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CDF, PDF and boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantiles\nTo summarise uncertainty, an assessor might want to find values that divide the range of the quantity into parts containing specified amounts of probability. Such values are known as quantiles.\nA quantile can be denoted with the letter P, together with the associated probability that the quantity would take a value below the quantile. For example, the value that divides a probability distribution into two parts with equal probabilities is the P50 quantile.\nThis value is also known as the median.\nQuartiles divide a probability distribution into four sections of equal probability. The first quartile is P25. The second quartile is the median P50. The third quartile is P75.\nA boxplot visualises quartiles.\nA percentile is another name for a quantile defined by the probability to the left of the quantile.\n\n\nProbability Density Function\nMost continuous quantities have a Probability Density Function (PDF).\nThe Probability Density Function express probabilities as area under its curve. The total area under the curve is 1, corresponding to 100% probability.\nThe area under the PDF curve to the left of the median is 50%.\nThe PDF can be thought of as a smooth histogram for a continuous quantity. Note that when used for a probability distribution, the area for the histogram should be 1.\n\n\nCumulative Distribution Function\nA probability distribution can be represented by its Cumulative Distribution Function (often abbreviated as CDF). The CDF gives the probability that the quantity is less than or equal to any specified value\nThe CDF contains all the information about probabilities for the quantity: for example, it can be used to calculate the probability that the quantity lies in any specified range of values.\nThis is a curve over the possible range of the quantity (on the x-axis) increasing from 0 to 100% probability (on the y-axis)."

    "text": "Uncertainty and variability\nUncertainty refers to the state of knowledge, whereas variability refers to actual variation or heterogeneity in the real world.\nBoth uncertainty and variability can be represented by probability distributions\n\n\n\nUncertainty and variability figure from EFSA\n\n\nThe left you see a probability distribution for a non-variable quantity - Let us call it parameter P. It is a single true value which is uncertain, and the distribution represents uncertainty about P.\nIn the center, you see a probability distribution for a variable quantity. This variable V has multiple true values. The probability distribution represents variability of V.\nTo the right you see a probabilistic model for both variability and uncertainty. We use a probability distribution to represent variability in this variable, but the true distribution for variability is unknown and we use probability distributions to represent our uncertainty about it’s variability. This distribution is sometimes referred to as a spaghetti plot or two-dimensional distribution.\nUncertainty may be altered (either reduced or increased) by further research, because it results from limitations in knowledge.\nVariability cannot be altered by obtaining more knowledge, because it refers to real differences in the world or how the assessors choose to model the world.\nIt is important that assessors distinguish uncertainty and variability because they have different implications for decision-making: informing decisions about whether to invest resources in research aimed at reducing uncertainty or in management options aimed at influencing variability (e.g. to change exposures to subgroups of the population)."
