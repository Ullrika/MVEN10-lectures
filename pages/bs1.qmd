## Risk aversion - lottery

-   The probability of winning is $p$.
-   A lottery ticket costs $1$ SEK.
-   If you win you get $100$ SEK.

The expected utility is: $$ EU = p \cdot 100 - 1 $$

Would you buy a ticket in this lottery?

-   If no, why? If yes, why?

::: notes
Utility is measured as Swedish kronor (SEK).

If no, you are risk averse If yes, you might enjoy the risk. In reality we do not have the fortune to be able to choose, it is rather about preventing bad things from happening.

Would you answer change if the ticket was free and you would win 99 SEK

## Two doors

In this case you are to choose one out of two doors. Behind every door there is a chance of winning $X$ with probability $p$. Thus, each door is a lottery with the expected utility $X\cdot p$.

-   Which lottery do you prefer in the three situations A, B and C?

## Expected utilities

-   A: $0.25\cdot 100 = 25$ vs $0.25\cdot 10 = 2.5$

-   B: $0.05\cdot 100 = 5$ vs $0.75\cdot 10 = 7.5$

-   C: $0.05\cdot 100 = 5$ vs $0.5\cdot 10 = 5$

## Linquistic uncertainty

> Impact on biodiversity is high

> There is a 30% probability of rain tomorrow

-   Prominent in qualitative risk assessment due to the use of qualitative expressions

-   Can be avoided by using well defined questions, quantities and outcomes and meaningful scales

## Subjective Risk Assessment

A tool from Mark and his colleagues to reduce linguistic uncertainty

## Subjective Risk Assessment

Rain - Rain tomorrow

Rocket - Next moon rocket crash on earth

Trump - Trump becomes the next president of USA

![Use these likelihood and impact scales](../img/aus_standards.png)

Make judgements with single scores e.g. 3 or ranges, e.g. 2-4

## Delphi process to aggregate judgements from a group of experts

-   Make individual judgements
-   Compare where there are large differences in judgements. - Discuss and resolve the reason for differences. Here is where linguistic uncertainties can be reduced.
-   Redo individual judgements
-   Aggregate the judgements

## Interpretation of probability

[Tutorial on uncertainty where Ullrika explains probability distribution](https://multimedia.efsa.europa.eu/uncertainty-tutorial/uncertainty-communication/expressions-distribution.html)

> the frequency with which sampled values arise within a specified range or for a specified category

> a quantification of a judgement on the likelihood of a particular range or category

::: callout-note
The mathematical theory for probability is the same for both interpretations!
