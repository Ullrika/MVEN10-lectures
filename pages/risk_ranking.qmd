## Linquistic uncertainty

> Impact on biodiversity is high

> There is a 30% probability of rain tomorrow

-   Prominent in qualitative risk assessment due to the use of qualitative expressions

-   Can be avoided by using well defined questions, quantities and outcomes and meaningful scales

## Subjective Risk Assessment

A tool from Mark and his colleagues to reduce linguistic uncertainty

## Subjective Risk Assessment

Rain - Rain tomorrow

Rocket - Next moon rocket crash on earth

Trump - Trump becomes the next president of USA

![Use these likelihood and impact scales](../img/aus_standards.png)

Make judgements with single scores e.g. 3 or ranges, e.g. 2-4

## Delphi process to aggregate judgements from a group of experts

-   Make individual judgements
-   Compare where there are large differences in judgements. - Discuss and resolve the reason for differences. Here is where linguistic uncertainties can be reduced.
-   Redo individual judgements
-   Aggregate the judgements

## Interpretation of probability

[Tutorial on uncertainty where Ullrika explains probability distribution](https://multimedia.efsa.europa.eu/uncertainty-tutorial/uncertainty-communication/expressions-distribution.html)

> the frequency with which sampled values arise within a specified range or for a specified category

> a quantification of a judgement on the likelihood of a particular range or category

::: callout-note
The mathematical theory for probability is the same for both interpretations!
