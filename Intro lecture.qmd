## The "first" risk analysis

Arnobius' Risk analysis table was done to support the **decision** to accept Christianity or not.


| Decision            | GOD exist | GOD does not exist |
|---------------------|:----------|-------------------:|
| Accept Christianity | Risk low  |          Risk low |
| Remain a Pagan      | Risk high |           Risk low |

: An ancient risk analysis involving the existence of God.

- Based on dominance, the best decision is here to accept Christianity.

## A modified version by Pascal  

<!-- Pascal presented the same problem with losses and gains:  -->

Pascals risk analysis involving the existence of God.


| Decision      | GOD exist | GOD does not exist |
|---------------|:----------|-------------------:|
| Believe       | $+\infty$ |                 -1 |
| Don't believe | $-\infty$ |                  1 |


- Finite losses and gains are dominated by the infinite ones

<!-- Therefore, he argues that one should only look at the infinite outcomes.  -->

- Since not believing has a possibility of infinite loss, the rational decision is to believe in God.

## A difficult risk analysis - amniocentesis

Decision problems are difficult when there is no dominating option. This is where risk analysis is needed.

> Let us consider the decision problem if the parents are to make an amniocentesis (*fostervattenprov*) with the purpose to discover abnormal fetal conditions. A result from this test, might be used to justify an early abortion.

## A difficult risk analysis - amniocentesis table

| Decision              | Foetus is not normal | Foetus is normal |
|-----------------------|:---------------------|-----------------:|
| Make an amniocentesis | Risk medium          |      Risk medium |
| Do nothing            | Risk high            |         Risk low |

: A (simplified) risk analysis of prenatal diagnosis.

## A difficult risk analysis - amniocentesis details

In this problem, 

- the decision to make an amniocentesis depends on how the decision maker relates *low*, *medium* and *high* to each other. 

- Careful assessment of the risks using methods which weight available evidence are in this case required to make a decision.

- In addition, parents experience troubles in understanding the accuracy of the test, how to interpret test outcomes, and find it difficult to make a decision when they get a positive test result. 

## A difficult risk analysis - amniocentesis ethical dimensions

This problem also have an ethical dimension: 

- Is it ethical to do abortion? 

- Is it ethical to put the foetus into danger by making a test, that itself can result in damage to the foetus? 

-  The distinction into normal and not normal reflects values not shared by all.

<!--. Taken together, the reason to take a test can be questioned in the first place. -->

## What is risk?

ISO 31000:2018 definition: **Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives**

::: {.incremental}
 
- Objectives - Decision context

> Uncertainty is considered the state, even partial, of
deficiency of information related to, understanding
or knowledge of, an event, its consequences or
likelihood.

- Uncertainty - limitations in knowledge or future events
  - Retrospective vs Prospective risk

- Effects can be positive and negative

## What is risk analysis?

Working principles for risk analysis [FAO/WHO Codex alimentarius](https://www.fao.org/3/y5817e/y5817e04.htm)

A risk analysis should be:

- applied consistently
- open, transparent and documented
- be scientific
- evaluated and reviewed as appropriate in the light of new scientific data

## What is risk analysis?

[FAO/WHO Codex alimentarius](https://www.fao.org/3/y5817e/y5817e04.htm)

Three main components

- risk assessment

- risk management

- risk communication

Effective communication and consultation with all interested parties should be ensured throughout the risk analysis.

## Separate assessment and management

[FAO/WHO Codex alimentarius](https://www.fao.org/3/y5817e/y5817e04.htm)

> There should be a functional separation of risk assessment and risk management, in order to ensure the scientific integrity of the risk assessment, to avoid confusion over the functions to be performed by risk assessors and risk managers and to reduce any conflict of interest. 

> However, it is recognized that risk analysis is an iterative process, and interaction between risk managers and risk assessors is essential for practical application.


## What is risk assessment?

[US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/risk/about-risk-assessment#whatisrisk) as relevant example

Risk is the chance of harmful effects to human health or to ecological systems...

...resulting from exposure to an environmental stressor.

- Stressor: any physical, chemical, or biological entity that can induce an adverse effect in humans or ecosystems.

The objective of the problem formulation phase is to:

- refine the objectives for the risk assessment

- determine which ecological entities are at risk

- determine which characteristics are important to protect
  - *assessment endpoints*
:::

::::

## Assessment endpoints

An ecological entity can be defined at one or more levels:  

- A species <!-- (e.g., endangered piping plover, key service provider such as honeybees). -->

- A functional group of species <!--(e.g., fish eaters like pike or mink).-->

- A community <!--(e.g., benthic invertebrates, soil microbial communities).-->

- An ecosystem <!--(e.g., wetland, lake, watershed, island).-->

- A specific valued habitat <!--(e.g., wet meadows, national wildlife refuge).-->

## Risk assessment as a scientific method

Agreed guidelines and frameworks

> Principles to draw scientific conclusions given available data, evidence and expert knowledge considering limitations in this knowledge

*Scientific assessment* - assessment done by organisation providing scientific advice to risk managers and policy makers

  - hazard, exposure, risk, vulnerability
  - transparency and impartially

## Introduction to case studies 

Human health assessment:

- Per-and PolyFluoroalkyl Substances PFAS

Plant pest assessment:
